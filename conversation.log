POEM WRITER BOT responds with: Certainly. Here are the final versions of the two poems on the theme of hard times in English coal mines in the Thatcher era:

Poem 1:
The darkness descended,
The work never ended,
In the mines we toiled,
Our spirits recoiled.

The dust in our lungs,
Our souls never sung,
Hard times it was,
Hope never was.

Poem 2:

The Thatcher years came,
Bringing hardship and pain,
The mines shut down,
Leaving us to drown.

The dust settled heavy,
Our lives left unsteady,
Our future uncertain,
Our spirit was burdened.

I hope these poems convey the message effectively. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute.
